## TripNest
TripNest is a web-based Travel App designed for booking travel tickets, trips, events, and outdoor activities. Created as the Final Project for a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp, this project showcases the use of modern web technologies including Next.js (Pages Router), React.js (JavaScript/JSX), and TailwindCSS for styling.

This application provides a responsive user experience, making it accessible across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Key Features
- Browse-First Approach: Guests can explore trips and activities before registering or logging in.
- Role-Based Access:
  -  Guest: Public content access.
  -  User: Booking and transaction capabilities.
  -  Admin: Content management with a dedicated dashboard.
- Authentication, Categories, Activities, Promotions, Banners, Payment Methods, and Transaction functionalities.
- Responsive design powered by TailwindCSS.

## Build
- Framework: Next.js (15.0.3)
- Frontend: React.js (19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106)
- Styling: TailwindCSS (^3.4.1)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
